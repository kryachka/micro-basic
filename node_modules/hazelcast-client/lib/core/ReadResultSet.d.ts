     * Similarly, if the reader requests an item in the future (e.g. because
     * the partition was lost and the reader was unaware of this), the read
     * method will jump back to the newest available sequence.
     * Because of these jumps and only in the case when the reader is loss
     * tolerant, the next sequence must be retrieved using this method.
     * A return value of `SEQUENCE_UNAVAILABLE` (`-1`) means that the
